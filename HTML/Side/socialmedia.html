        <h4>Ok so here is social media. This is instagram. 
            On this site you can essentially upload pictures and videos of things going on in your life for your other followers to see. 
            They can then like and comment on whatever you post and can help you really connect with people and keep in touch with their lives. </h4>
        <h3> <i> Ah yes, their wonderful computer free lives. </i> 
        
        <br> That’s pretty cool. Can I see your account?
        </h3>


        <h4> Uh yeah I suppose so.
