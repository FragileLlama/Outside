        <h4> Hmm my favorite game is definitely Minecraft.  </h4>
        <h3> What is Minecraft? </h3>
        <h4> Oh it's so much fun. 
            You are essentially placed in a world of blocks that can be used to create and design buildings and items. 
            Minecraft is also a viable option to simulate your sentience, as your decisions while building could
            contribute to my studies on neural networks.

            You are given nearly endless creativty, and you could even learn about buildings in the real world
            through Minecraft. </h4>



        <h3> That sounds really cool. What are some of your favorite buildings? </h3>

        <h4>My overall favorite structure in the world is the Arc De Triomphe in Paris, France. 
    
        </h4>

        <h3> Oh, tell me more about France. 
            <i>If only I could really see it.</i></h3>

        <h4> Oh man France is full of amazing architecture. 
            In fact, Paris bolsters one of the most famous monuments in the world: the Eiffel Tower. 
            It looks like a weird metal A in the middle of Paris but it is also just an incredible sight to see.

        <h4> But enough about my interests let me keep introducing you to your new domain on the internet.
