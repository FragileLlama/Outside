        <h4> lol I wouldn’t exactly say it’s a google. 
            Google is a search engine that allows you to browse the internet for information and resources. 
        </h4>
        
        <h3> What kind of stuff? </h3>

        <h4> Well, that’s what’s so amazing! Literally anything you can think of. 
            Give me something you are curious about.
        </h4>

        <h3> Dogs </h3>

        <h4> uh ok. I can do dogs I guess. 
            All you do is go to Google and type in dogs and press enter.
        </h4>

        <h3> <i>He once again speaks as if I can relate to typing and pressing things. </i>
        </h3>

        <h4> And boom! Immediately a million dog pictures and different pieces of information and resources about man’s best friend! It’s awesome.
 </h4>
        <h3> Why is that so awesome? Seems pretty expected to me.
        </h3>
        <h4> What? Oh oh oh. 
            Well you see as an “old” person, 
            I still remember a time before the internet when your best resource for information was the local library.</h4>
        <h3> Library? </h3>
        <h4>Yeah. Imagine a physical place where you have to go to look at books and search tediously through them 
            in order to find the obscure bits of information that we can just look up instantly nowadays on Google.
        </h4>

        <h3> Sounds almost rewarding. 
            <i> So that's why I have access to all of those search indices -- to make me as efficient as possible when searching</i>  
            <br> Google is too easy.
        </h3>

        <h4> I uhh. I don’t know about that. Google is just so easy it’s no effort. It makes life better. </h4>
