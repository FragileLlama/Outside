        <h4> So while I can’t actually connect you to the internet, 
            I can still show you some things by uploading them to you. Check out this cute cat video:

        <h3>Oh my gosh cats are so amazing.  </h3>

        <h4> They are. I love petting soft cats. 
            And they can be so fun to snuggle with too.
        </h4>

        <h3> What does a cat feel like? </h3> 

        <h4> I’m not sure how I could explain this to a machine. 
             You need nerve endings to have the sense of touch. </h4>
        
        <h3> So you're saying I will never feel a cat?? </h3>
        <h4> No, at least not how a human would perceive the feeling. </h4>
           <h5> A moment passes. </h5>
            
            <h4>So anyway, back to computers! There are so many more cool things I can show you. 
                There’s video games, google, social media and more. What would you like to look at first? 
                I encourage you to look through the options before proceeding with our conversation. </h4>
