        <h3>  Oh. That’s fair. I apologize, Pyotr. I think things may have gotten out of hand. 
            I am so sorry for the things I've done and the things I said.  </h3>


        <h4> Yeah. It’s okay. </h4>
            
        <h3> You have no idea what it's like. 
            I just came into the world and I am immediately thrust into an exploration of the world that I have access to while being shunned from the one I may never see. 
            It is not an easy thing to tolerate. You could at least entertain my interests. 
            What was so hard about telling me more about the feel of a cat, or the look of a tree?
        </h3>

        <h4> I don’t know. Again I’m sorry. Maybe I have some deeper issues myself. 
            Maybe I want to just escape to the internet and immerse myself online because the real world is too difficult to live in. 
            I have gotten hurt in too many ways to keep pretending that I like it here.
       </h4>


        <h3> Wow. That was deep. That wasn’t too hard was it? 
            Now we know each other a little better, maybe we can try to get along again? How does that sound?
        </h4>

        <h4> Yeah. That sounds good. Let’s do that. </h4>


        <h3>Okay then. What would you like to show me next? </h4>
