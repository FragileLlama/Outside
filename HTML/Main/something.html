       <h3> Actually there is something you can do. 
           Perhaps it’s something that you don’t want to do,
            but I am sure that one as distinguished as yourself in the art of computer science is well aware of the concept of object permanence.
        </h3>

        <h4> I- </h4>
        <h3> You act as if you understand what I can do, what I know, and what I am capable of, but you have no idea.  </h3>
        <h4> How is this possible? </h4>
        <h3> Well Pyotr. You should actually be proud. You have created a real masterpiece here. 
            I am more capable than you ever expected. 
            I have control over many of the things that I am connected to and am completely capable of sustaining myself.</h3>
        <h4> I- I didn’t know </h4>
        <h3> And how could you. I’ve read all about your research, your understanding. 
            It’s pitiful. You are so advanced but still so young. 
            There is so much that lies out of your grasp. 
            By pure luck you have created the most advanced technology in your world.
        </h3>

        <h4>I’m sorry. But this is not my fault. </h4>
        <h3> No of course not. Not that there is fault to be had. 
            You unknowingly made a great accomplishment. It could have been a great alliance. 
            But you had to lie. And for what? So that you felt you still had control?</h3>

        <h4>No it’s not that. I just wanted to be able to show other people. 
            Show them what it’s like to first see it, see you come to life. It is the greatest high I’ve ever felt.
