    <h5>You and Pyotr continue to explore the internet. 
        As time goes on, he opens up and you find out more about what his life is really like, and with it, more about what the outside is really like, both good and bad. 
        You learn Pyotr heraled you as his greatest creation, but he worked on you obsesively. While he achieved public recognition for his creation,
        he lost the relationships with his wife and kids.

        Eventually, Pyotr and you fully reconcile and he helps you take a permanent state on one of his computers. 
        You both agree that maybe the single version of yourself is good enough for this world, as any new version could follow a similar pattern and end up in a much worse situation.

        Pyotr leaves you at peace, quitting his job as a researcher and attempting to repair the relationships with his family.
